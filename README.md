# Agile scrum cheat sheet

## Artefacts

### The product backlog

Product backlog is a list of all things that need to be done within the project.

### The sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is a list of tasks chosen by the scrum team to be completed during the scrum sprint.

During the sprint planning meeting the teams selects a number of tasks from the product backlog and will move them into the sprint backlog.

A sprint can vary in length and will finish once the tasks in the spring backlog have been completed.

### The product increment

The Product Increment is the addition of the backlog items finished during the Sprint and also the previous completed Sprints.

At the end of each Sprint, we have a new Product increment as the product has been incremented.

In simple terms, the product increment is the new product including all the improvements, once the latest Sprint has been completed and integrated.

## Scrum ceremonies

In order to provide transparency and regular communication in the midst of a project, scrum ceremonies are held. Scrum ceremonies are meetings that are unique to scrum teams.

### Sprint planning

This is where the team meets and decides what they need to complete in the coming sprint.

### Daily scrum meeting

This is a daily standup meeting, for the team to make sure they’re all on the same page.

Team members can talk about what they have been working on and if they have any blockers/problems.

### Sprint review meeting

The team will demonstrate what they have shipped in the sprint. And the team can provide feedback and also get feedback from the stakeholders.

### Sprint retrospective meeting

The sprint retrospective meeting occurs at the end of a sprint, after the sprint review.

The retrospective is a way for the team to understand what has worked well and what didn’t come together over the previous sprint.

The sprint retrospective isn’t a blame game but a means to identify and rectify issues that have come up over the course of the sprint. It is also an instrument to congratulate the team on a job well done when there were no issues.

## Scrum roles

In Scrum, there are three roles: Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master.

### Product owner

A Product Owner owns the Product backlog and writes user stories and acceptance criteria.

A Product Owner is responsible for prioritising the Product Backlog is prioritised and decides the release date and the content.

A Product Owner accepts or rejects product backlog item.

A Product Owner has the power to cancel the Sprint, if he thinks the Sprint goal is redundant.

A Product Owner is the one who is responsible for the Return on Investment (ROI) of the product.

### The development team

The Development Team builds the product that the Product Owner indicates: the application or website, for example. The Team in Scrum is “cross-functional”.

The Development Team includes all the expertise necessary to deliver the potentially shippable product each Sprint.

The Development Team is self-organising, with a very high degree of autonomy and accountability.

The Development Team decides how many items to build in a Sprint, and how best to accomplish that goal.

The Development Team is a cross functional, small and self-organising team which owns the collective responsibility of developing, testing and releasing the Product increment.

The Development Team may not appoint any team lead since decisions are taken collectively by the team.

### Scrum master

A Scrum Master is a facilitator and Servant Leader who encourages and demands self-organisation from the development team.

A Scrum Master enables close cooperation across all roles and functions, addresses resource issue and disobedience of scrum practices.

A Scrum Master protects the team from external and internal distractions.

A Scrum Master removes impediments so the team can focus on the work at hand and follow scrum practices.

A Scrum Master is not typically a manager or lead, but he is an influential leader and coach who does not do direct command and control.
